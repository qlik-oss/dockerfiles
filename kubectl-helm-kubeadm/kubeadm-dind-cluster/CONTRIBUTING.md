# Contributing Guidelines

Read the following guide if you're interested in contributing to kubeadm-dind-cluster.

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA). More information about the CLA and instructions for signing it [can be found here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md).

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the repository.

## Finding Things That Need Help

If you're new to the project and want to help, but don't know where to start, we have a semi-curated list of issues that should not need deep knowledge of the system. [Have a look and see if anything sounds interesting](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubeadm-dind-cluster/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Alternatively, read some of the docs on other controllers and try to write your own, file and fix any/all issues that come up, including gaps in documentation!

## Contributing a Patch

1. If you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Submit a pull request.

All changes must be code reviewed. Coding conventions and standards are explained in the official [developer docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel). Expect reviewers to request that you avoid common [go style mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) in your PRs.

### Merge Approval

kubeadm-dind-cluster maintainers may add "LGTM" (Looks Good To Me) or an equivalent comment to indicate that a PR is acceptable. Any change requires at least one LGTM.  No pull requests can be merged until at least one kubeadm-dind-cluster maintainer signs off with an LGTM.
